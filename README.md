# timezone-converter
A simple, ad-free USA (EST) to India (IST) time converter built for personal use as a Network Engineer. Most tools online are bloated with features I don't need â€” this is clean, fast, and built with the help of AI to make timezone coordination effortless for my daily workflow.
